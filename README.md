# coffee_and_code_webscraping
Code for Code and Coffee presentation on August 7th, 2018

Sample code for talk given on August 7th, 2018 at Norfolk Data Science. 

Examples provided range from grabbing simple data from a locally created html file to grabbing 
pricing info from a company's web page. Makes use of Python library beautiful soup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to grab data from static html pages and splinter (https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is a web driver built off of Selenium to allow for automated control of a Chrome web browser.

Note: Later examples may not work in the future as websites are always subject to change and small changes
      in the html/css of the page can break the examples. As such a pure data config file was used to allow
      for quick changes, but is not being actively maintained.
